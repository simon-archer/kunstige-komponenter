# Create a Simple Chat UI Using Kunstige Komponenter

## Task

Create a clean, modern chat application UI using the Kunstige Komponenter web component library. The implementation should demonstrate the capabilities of the component library while providing a functional chat interface.

## Requirements

1. Build a chat application interface with:
   - Header area
   - Navigation/contacts sidebar
   - Main conversation area
   - Message input

2. Make the interface responsive for both desktop and mobile views

3. Implement basic interactivity:
   - Sending and receiving messages
   - Switching between conversations
   - Mobile-friendly sidebar toggling

4. Include some sample data to demonstrate the UI

## Component Documentation

The documentation for the Kunstige Komponenter library is available in the llms.txt file. This contains details about:

- All available components
- Their attributes and properties
- Event handling
- Styling options

Feel free to choose which components make the most sense for your implementation. For example, you might use ki-header, ki-sidebar, ki-message-field, and other components as needed.

You have creative freedom regarding:

- The overall layout and component selection
- Color scheme (using CSS variables for theming)
- Interaction patterns
- Message styling and organization

## Output Requirements

Please deliver a single HTML file that:
- Imports the Kunstige Komponenter bundle from a CDN
- Contains all necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Works in modern browsers without additional dependencies
- Demonstrates the key features of a chat interface

## Getting Started
